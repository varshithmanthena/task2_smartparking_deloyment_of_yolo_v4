Deploying smart parking using YOLOv4 (You Only Look Once version 4) involves utilizing its object detection capabilities to manage and monitor parking spaces effectively. Hereâ€™s an outline of the process:
1. Overview of YOLOv4
- YOLOv4 is an advanced object detection algorithm that can identify and classify objects in real-time with high accuracy. In smart parking, it can detect vehicles, vacant spaces, and even license plates.


2. Setup for Smart Parking Deployment
a. Data Collection:
- Gather images/videos of parking areas, including a variety of lighting conditions, angles, and vehicle types.

b. Model Training:
- Annotate the dataset using tools like LabelImg to label parking spaces and vehicles.
- Train YOLOv4 on the annotated dataset to detect empty and occupied parking spaces.
- Use frameworks like Darknet or PyTorch to implement YOLOv4.

c. Hardware Requirements:
- Ensure you have cameras installed in parking areas to capture real-time footage.
- Use a server or cloud infrastructure for processing the footage and running YOLOv4.


3. System Architecture
- Input Layer: Cameras feed live video footage to the system.
- Processing Layer: The YOLOv4 model processes the video stream to detect vehicles and vacant spots.
- Output Layer: The system displays real-time parking availability via screens or mobile apps.


4. Integration
- Develop a user interface (web or mobile app) to display parking availability to users.
- Set up an alert system for parking violations or reserved spaces.
- Integrate payment systems for seamless parking fee management.


5. Deployment
- Deploy YOLOv4 on an edge device or cloud platform for real-time processing.
- Ensure the system is scalable to handle multiple cameras and parking areas.
